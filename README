JAPriorityQueue

A priority queue in Objective-C, using the standard binary heap algorithm.
Inserted objects are extracted in sort order according to some selector (which
is expected to take an object and return an NSComparisonResult).

Will not build under ARC. It should interact fine with ARC code if built with
-fno-objc-arc.
